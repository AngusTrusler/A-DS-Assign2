This assignment was completed in Semester 2 2018, as part of my Algorithms and Data Structures course. 
The task was to develop a data structure in which large volumes of text (In this case, the complete works of Shakespeare) would be stored in such a way that for a given word, the location of each occurrence in that word could be found (line, character). For extra marks, we could implement similar functionality for phrases. We were then to write a report on our strategy and identify and explain, in Big O notation, the access time and storage qualities of our implementation.

My strategy was to use a Compressed Retrieval Tree, and further details about my approach are written up in the provided report. 

Enclosed is a copy of the entire java directory, but for ease of access I have included a copy of the main file of note.
